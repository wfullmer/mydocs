Welcome to wdf's docs!
======================

Hello World. My name is William D. Fullmer and this is my documentation... 
basically just an html version of my CV. My professional interests lie 
mostly in the areas of applied computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with 
particular emphasis on 

-  multiphase gas-liquid and particulate gas-solid flows,
-  verification, validation & uncertainty quantification,
-  surrogate modeling of CFD-data,   
-  nonlinear dynamics \& chaos, and 
-  nuclear reactor thermal-hydraulics and safety analysis. 

My graduate and post-graduate education was at Purdue University's School of 
Nuclear Engineering, with BS, MS and PhD degrees in May 2008, Dec. 2009, and 
Aug. 2014. Following my PhD, I post-doc'ed in Prof. Christine M. Hrenya's 
research group in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering at the 
University of Colorado, Boulder. Presently, I am a member of the Leidos Research
Support Team at the US DOE's National Energy Technology Laboratory in 
Morgantown, West Virginia supporting the MFiX-Exa project. The rest of my pages
are outlined below. 

Thanks for visiting!
